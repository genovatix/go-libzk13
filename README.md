# ZK13 Protocol Implementation in Go

This repository contains an implementation of the ZK13 protocol, a cryptographic scheme for zero-knowledge proofs, written in Go. The ZK13 protocol allows a prover (Bob) to demonstrate knowledge of a secret to a verifier (Alice) without revealing the secret itself. This implementation emphasizes variable prime lengths for security and performance testing.

## Features

- Implementation of the ZK13 protocol in Go.
- Support for variable prime lengths to adjust security levels.
- Performance analysis using Go's `pprof` for CPU and memory profiling.
- Demonstrates proof generation and verification processes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Go installed on your system. This project was developed with Go version 1.15 or newer. You can check your Go version using:

```bash
go version
```

### Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/genovatix/zk13
cd zk13
```

### Running the Program

To run the program and test different prime lengths:

```bash
go run main.go
```

### Profiling Performance

To profile the program's performance for CPU and memory usage, run:

```bash
go build -o zk13
./zk13
```

Then, analyze the performance profiles using:

```bash
go tool pprof cpu.prof
go tool pprof mem.prof
```

## Usage

This project is intended for educational purposes and as a demonstration of implementing cryptographic protocols in Go. It showcases the use of zero-knowledge proofs with variable prime lengths for enhanced security.
